			    <p>This year will be my 4th AIDS/Lifecycle after a 7 years break with 
			    the fantastic events. My life changed so much because of AIDS/Lifecycle, 
			    and many people benefited directly from their services, your support 
			    means the world to me. Weâ€™re working together to make HIV/AIDS a thing 
			    of the past. I'm donating $500 to the cause myself. Will you also support 
			    me by making a donation today?</p>
			    <p>Please follow my blog of this emotional journey. I will also post the 
			    same blog on Medium so it can contain pictures and videos. https://medium.
